				The series, which is set in the 1980s, centers on the citizens of the made-up small town of Hawkins, Indiana, who are subjected to a hostile alternate dimension known as the "Upside Down" after a nearby facility for human experimentation creates a portal between the alternate reality and the real world. The plot of the first season of "Stranger Things" revolved around a little boy who became lost in an alternate world and how his friends came to his aid. The characters are currently in high school and have endured numerous interdimensional incursion-related traumas.

				<h6><b>Eleven</b></h6>
				<h9>Dr. Martin Brenner took Eleven from her mother at birth, and she was fostered as a test subject in Hawkins National Laboratory to hone her psychokinetic abilities. She can use remote vision to enter other dimensions when put in a sensory-deprivation tank, largely for espionage.</h9>

					<h6><b>Max Mayfield</b></h6>
					<h9>Max struggled to live normally in 1986 as she still mourned Billy's passing. She isolated herself from her friends and suffered physically. She felt responsible for wishing Billy's death because she was present when he passed away and held herself accountable for not being able to protect him from the Mind Flayer.</h9>

					<h9>Over the friends he already has, he is wary, cautious, doubtful, judgmental, and protective. Despite the fact that he is not actually harsh or mean, some of Lucas's negative traits give the impression that he is; on occasion, he exhibits fits of rage, but he can also be incredibly kind.</h9>
